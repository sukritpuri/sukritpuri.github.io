        <p>Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at MIT, specializing in Political Economy and Quantitative Methods. 
          I study business and politics in emerging economies, and am writing a dissertation about family firms in India. MIT News covered my work <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/all-in-family-sukrit-puri-0604" target="_blank">here.</a>
          <br><br>
        I graduated with Honors in Economics from Princeton University, and prior to MIT, I worked as an investment analyst at Goldman Sachs.  
          <br><br>
        I am on the fall 2024 academic job market. 
      </p>

       <b>Corporate Kinship: Political Attachments of the Family Firm</b> <br>
        <i>Job Market Paper</i><br>
        <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>Why do firms participate in politics? Scholars tend to assume instrumental intent behind corporate political activity, describing firms as making profit-maximizing investments in the political arena. These theories ignore how internal corporate structure and social embededness of the firms affects its political strategy. In this paper, I focus on the family firm---the most common type of business in the world---and show how it faces a series of non-economic incentives that constrains its politics. I borrow from management and economic sociology to develop a political theory that predicts family firms to deviate from opportunistic, rent-seeking, behavior in the political arena, and instead be tied by obligations to kinship networks. To test these theories, I assemble the universe of corporate campaign contributions to political parties in India from 2003-2021. Despite operating in a competitive multi-party environment, I find family involvement in firm operations is strongly associated with firms loyally supporting a single co-ethnic political party, with little evidence that this strategy pays dividends in the form of private political favors.

       <b>Reputational Costs of Revealing Political Connections: Evidence from Electoral Bonds in India</b> <br>
       <i>Under Review </i> <br>
       <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
        <div class="content">
        <p>Why do companies choose to hide potentially beneficial political connections? I show that revealing political activities can hurt a company's valuation in the short run by tainting its reputation. I take advantage of a unique setting where the Election Commission of India suddenly revealed a list of previously-anonymous corporate donors to political parties. Publicly listed companies revealed to be political donors experienced a 1.5% cumulative abnormal underperformance over the next 7 days as a result of this information shock, amounting to an erosion of approximately $9 billion in market capitalization---over 5 times the amount raised by political parties in the first place. The effect is short-lived and is largely driven by companies facing negative press immediately following the reveal.</p>

        <b>Mapping the Landscape of Corporate Campaign Contributions to Political Parties in India</b> <br>
        <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The study of money in politics has largely remained restricted to developed countries, where data are more readily available. But the concerns about corporate political funding, and how business influences the state broadly, are a global phenomenon. I collect all donations to political parties in India between 2003-2021, by taking advantage of a successful Right to Information Act that require all political parties to disclose donations made above Rs 20,000 (approx 250 USD). By developing a web-scraping based entity resolution algorithm that outperforms conventional exact and fuzzy string matching techniques, I am able to uniquely identify the universe of over 7000 corporate donors making donations to 40 political parties over the 18 year period. In this paper, I describe the steps taken to construct this dataset, describe a set of five stylized facts about the nature of corporate-political linkages in the world's largest democracy, and highlight a set of empirical puzzles that challenge expectations from the literature and invite future scholarship on this topic. </p>
